# holdinghands

Premise
Holding Hands is a visualizer for a song of the same name built primarly with JavaScript and HTML. The visualizer utilzes the Web Audio API as well
as the THREE.js library to create a 'living' environment as a backdrop for the Holding Hands song.

Time Line:
Music File plays on loop when page loads (optional: pauses on spacebar)(6/25/2020)
Environment renders on page loading - appears living and has movement (6/26/2020)
Evironment encapsulates entire screen after window resize (6/27/2020)
Background movement occurs congruent to music files 'bpm' (TBD)
